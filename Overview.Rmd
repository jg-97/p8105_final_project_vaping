# Motivation

Vaping, the inhaling of a vapor created by vaping devices like e-cigarettes, was initially regarded as a less harmful substitution for cigarettes. However, vaping still introduces nicotine into the body. The prevalence of lung damage caused by vaping is actually so high that the CDC[[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213260019304096?via=ihub)] needed to issue guidance explicitly on it.  As the popularity of vaping grows, concerns about vaping are covered both in academia and in the press[[2](https://health.usnews.com/health-care/for-better/articles/2018-06-13/how-teenage-vaping-puts-structure-in-place-for-heroin-and-cocaine-addiction),[3](https://www.cnn.com/2015/09/04/us/vaping-abuse/index.html)]. A journal article published last week even describes the prevalence of vaping in a "red alert" state[[4](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41271-019-00193-2)]. In press, vaping is accused of being both a  gateway drug and a new "drug" itself. To provide grounds for potential public health interventions on this "scourge of drug"[[5](https://www.cnn.com/2015/09/04/us/vaping-abuse/index.html)], we will evaluate the current landscape of vaping usage among teenagers and young adults in NYC using pre-collected data and analyze the potential risks of vaping in terms of future substance abuse and mental hygiene condistions.


# Dataset

Below are some datasets that dive into these topics and we intend on using

1.    National Survey on Drug Use and Health ([NSDUH](<https://www.samhsa.gov/data/all-reports?f[]=field_report_and_document_type:6461&f[]=field_samhsa_survey:6511&f%5B%5D[]=field_report_and_document_type:6461&f%5B%5D[]=field_samhsa_survey:6511&order=desc&sort=field_date_printed_on_report&items_per_page=15&page=0>)) offers the information of multiple drugs.

2.   [YRBSS](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/data.htm) Data contains data of the youths' risk behaviors.

3.   [State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation (State) Sytem](https://nccd.cdc.gov/STATESystem/rdPage.aspx?rdReport=OSH_State.CustomReports&rdAgReset=True&rdShowModes=showResults&rdShowWait=true&rdPaging=Interactive&islMeasure=180EVP) provides the data of NYC tobacco use.

4.   [Youth Risk Behavior Survey](https://a816-healthpsi.nyc.gov/epiquery/YRBS/yrbsIndex.html) contains information of risk behaviors in youths around New York City.
