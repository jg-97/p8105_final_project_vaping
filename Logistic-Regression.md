\#\#\#Manual selection

## Function definition

The following code chunck define the functions that is gonna be used to
generate and mapped on the cv dataframe, i.e.Â it build up the component
of the pipeline.

``` r
###Function that do auto log reg

## function for cv
#crossv_mc(df,n)

## function for autologreg
log_reg_auto = function(cv_df,formular = manual_formular){
  cv_df %>%mutate(
###Automodel selection with AIC as criterial
         automodel  = map(train, ~glm(current_vaping ~., data = .x, family = binomial(),na.action = na.exclude)%>%MASS::stepAIC(trace = FALSE))
 ) }


###Do lasso stat learning
lasso = function(cv_df){
  lasso_temp = cv.glmnet(current_vaping ~., data = cv_df, family = "binomial")
glmnet(current_vaping ~., data = cv_df, family = "binomial",lambda = lasso_temp$lambda.min)
}

###find prediction accuracy
accy = function(model,data){
  Temp = predict(model, data, type = "response")%>%round()
1-mean(Temp-(as.numeric(pull(as.tibble(data),current_vaping))-1))
  }
```

## data input selection:

This part control the datas that was used to feed in the pipeline

``` r
# Extracting necessary variables
df = df_total%>%
  select(
    # binary respone
    current_vaping,
    # possible predictor
    carring_weapon,
    sad_hopeless,
    attempted_suicide,
    injurious_suicide_attempt,
    safety_concerns_at_school,
    threatened_at_school,
    physical_fighting,
    bullying_at_school,
    bullying_electronically,
    sex,
    age,
    race7,
    borough,
    illegal_injected_drug_use,
sex_before_13,
multiple_sex_partner,
sexual_contact_2
,year)


df1517 = df%>%filter(year == 2015|year == 2017)%>%na.omit()
df15 = df%>%filter(year == 2017)%>%na.omit()
df17 = df%>%filter(year == 2015)%>%na.omit()
```

### Actual pipeline

The following part commbine all the component of the pipelines and feed
the table.

``` r
###Set the manual selected predictor and response for the manual model
manual_formular = current_vaping ~ sad_hopeless + attempted_suicide  + safety_concerns_at_school + threatened_at_school + physical_fighting + bullying_electronically + carring_weapon + year

### run the actual pipeline

  crossv_mc(df1517,n=10)%>%
  ##stepAIC
  log_reg_auto()%>%
  ## Manual model
  mutate(manualmodel = map(train, ~glm(manual_formular, data = .x, family = binomial,na.action = na.exclude)))%>%
  ## Lasso model
  mutate(lassomodel = map(train,~lasso(.x)))

whether the prediction accuracy has been imporved.
