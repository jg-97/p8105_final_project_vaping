In this page, we will give you interpretation of the plot and the corresponding question each graph answers.


## Interpretation of vaping & drug use plots 

<center><img src = "images/cigarette.png" style = "width:100%"> </center>

* Among five kinds of drugs(vaping), alcohol holds the highest proportion but decreases in use from 2007 across five boroughs in NYC. In addition, cigarette has a lower total proportion than alcohol but the similar decreasing trend after 2009. 

* Cigar maintains the steady but low-proportion trend during 2003-2017, which could be compared with marijuana holding steady but higher proportion in total. Moreover, the marijuana users in Manhattan increase from the lowest level to highest level among five boroughs during 2007-2011. 

* Vaping, which is our target subject, hold the increasing trend from 2015-2017. This trend is quite similar to the alcohol, cigar and cigarette before being intervented, and maintains at the same proportion level with marijuana in 2015-2017, which indicates that it can grow into a new drug threatening the public health.
